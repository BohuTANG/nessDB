This is a low level nessDB LuaJIT FFI binding.
It expose nessDB C structures and C functions.
It's a "Think in C" binding.

The main use is for my nessDB testing.

HOW TO TEST :
First, compile libnessdb.so
cd interface/luajit_ffi
luajit ./nessdb.lua
OR
./nessdb.lua (only work if execute bit is set)
