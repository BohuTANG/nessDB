This is nessDB LuaJIT FFI binding.

nessdb.lua module expose nessDB C structures and C functions.
It's a "Think in C" binding.

test.lua use the low level binding but define user friendly functions.
Use it as an exemple.

HOW TO TEST :
First, compile libnessdb.so (default target in the toplevel Makefile).
The file nessdb.lua load the libnessdb.so library, check the path in nessdb.lua if file location change.

Then,
cd interface/luajit_ffi
luajit ./test.lua
OR
./test.lua (only work if execute bit is set)
