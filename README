================================================================

  nessDB is a fast Key-Value database(embedded), supports Redis-Protocol(PING,SET,MSET,GET,MGET,DEL,EXISTS,INFO,SHUTDOWN).
  Which is written in ANSI C with BSD LICENSE and works in most POSIX systems without external dependencies.

  nessDB is very efficient on disk-based random access, since it's using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees.

  The 1.8 version is still under construction.

  V1.8 FEATURES
  =============
  a. Better performances on Random-Read/Random-Write
  b. Log recovery
  c. Using LSM-Tree as storage engine
  d. Background detached-thread merging
  e. Support billion data
  For more details, please refer to documentations which in 'Doc' folder.

  HOW TODO BENCHMARK
  ==================
  $make db-bench
  $./db-bench <write | read > <count> 
	or 
  $./db-bench readone <key>

  If you want delete all idnexes/db/logs, you should do:
  $make cleandb

  HOW TO USE AS DB ENGINE
  =======================
  a. OPEN
		struct nessdb *db = db_open(db-path, is_log_recovery); 

  b. ADD
  		struct slice sk, sv;
		sk.len = 3;
		sk.data = "key";
		sv.len = 5;
		sv.data = "value";
		db_add(db, &sk, &sv);

  c. DELETE
  		struct slice sk;
		sk.len = 3;
		sk.data = "key";
		db_remove(db, &sk);

  d. READ
  		struct slice sk, sv;
		sk.len = 3;
		sk.data = "key";
		int ret = db_get(db, &sk, &sv);
		if (ret == 1) {
			printf("data is %s", sv.data);
			free(sv.data);
		} else
			print("Not found");

  e. CLOSE
  		db_close(db);

  HOW TO USE AS DB SERVER
  =======================
  $make db-server
  $./db-server
  Now, you can connect it with anyone redis-client, even can use the redis-benchmark for performance testing(Note the db-server only support a few redis command).

  *NOTICE*: The last stable branch is v1.8-rc[x], *DO NOT* use the 'unstable' branch!



  Thanks for your attention!
